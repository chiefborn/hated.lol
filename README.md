## 🎨 Adding Your Own Assets

This repository is kept lightweight by excluding media files. To get the full experience shown in the preview, you'll need to add your own assets to the `assets/` folder.

### Required Files
Add these files with **exact filenames** to the `assets/` folder:
- Music files (MP3 format recommended)
- Video files (MP4 format recommended) 
- Fonts (TTF/OTF formats)
- GIFs and images (PNG/JPG/GIF formats)

### Customization Options
- **Easy Mode:** Use the exact filenames expected by the current script
- **Custom Mode:** Modify `script.js` to use your own filenames and preferences
- **Full Control:** Completely rewrite the asset loading system to match your style

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Feel free to experiment with different media sources like YouTube, music libraries, or your own creations!
